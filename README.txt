=== DATA PREPERATION ===
Within the submission there are 2 datasets:

=>Celeb-DF-Image-Face-Crop
=>Celeb-DF-Image-Face-Crop-SRM

Extract these so that you can execute each jupyter notebooks.

=== EXECUTION ===

DO NOT EXECUTE Pre-process.ipynb This was built for generating the two datasets above.
I have completed this process for you.

Before running the individual models, please make sure that the paths provided are correct for your machine I have made the relative but 
they may cause isues.
Once that is done, run the models.
